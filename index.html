  <p>In I Voítheia Apó psilá  lived a young god called the Prostatis (The Protector).  
    <br>Prostatis was at the age; where young boys become men and when love takes center stage.
    <br> He fell deeply in love with Ofilia. A human, selected and appointed by the gods. 
    <br>Ofillia was granted immortality in exchange for life long servírisma (servitide) to gods.

  <p>Prostatis' father, O Theós tou Polémou (The God of War) hated the love Prostatis had for Ofillia; 
    <br>a mere mortal.  So O Theós tou Polémou devised a plan to kill Ofillia.
    <br> He got Ofillia alone and kicked her off of the edge of I Voítheia Apó psilá and into the weightless sky.

  <p>Prostatis saw what his father had done and flew with all his might to save Ofilia from plundging to the ground. 
    <br> O Theós tou Polémou, determined to divide and conquer created
    <br> a great barrier which separated the city of I Voítheia Apó psilá and the waters and earth below. A barrier 
    <br>which prevented humans from seeing the city of In I Voítheia Apó psilá.

    <p>O Theá tou Neroú (the goddess of water and the mother to Prostatis) saw what O Theós tou Polémou had done.  
      <br>She quickly summoned the waters below to rise and catch Ofillia.
      <br> Ofillia fell within the deepths of the water which pulled her onto land below.  
      <br>O Theá tou Neroú, in order to soothe her sons heart created a break in O Theós tou Polémou's 
      <br> barrier.  However, the barrier was lifted for only a few moments in the morning.

      <p>Caution: This is a love story that has only been passed down through the ages and has now been written. <br>
      Each iteration of this story has been told slightly different than the latter. Like most love storys in <br>
